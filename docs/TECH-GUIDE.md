# Bauify technical guide: what is behind the code

Written for someone reading this repository for the first time. Each section answers four questions: what this is, where it is in the code, why it is used, and where it bites. When you meet something unfamiliar while reading the code, come back here.

The suggested reading order follows the pipeline: the runtime first (Node, ESM), then the contracts (JSON Schema), then the technology behind each stage in the order extract → graphs → evaluate → overlay / bridge, and finally tests and cross-platform issues.

---

## 1. Runtime: Node.js and ES modules

### What it is

Bauify is a Node.js command-line program. The `.mjs` extension means the files are **ES modules** (ESM), JavaScript's official module system, using `import` / `export` statements rather than CommonJS's `require()` / `module.exports`.

```js
// extract/py/index.mjs
import { spawnSync } from 'node:child_process';   // a Node built-in, with the node: prefix
import { fail } from '../shared/diagnostics.mjs';  // a file in this repository; the extension is mandatory
export const id = 'py';
export function extract(root, config) { … }
```

### Why

`"type": "module"` in `package.json` makes the whole package ESM by default. ESM was chosen over CommonJS for two reasons: Archify is ESM too, so the style matches; and an ESM `import` is static, which is exactly the "statically analysable dependency" property Bauify relies on when it analyses other people's code.

### Where it bites

- Relative imports in ESM **must include the extension**: `'./files.mjs'`, not `'./files'`.
- There is no `__dirname` in ESM. To find the directory of the current file use `fileURLToPath(import.meta.url)`; the top of `extract/py/index.mjs` does exactly that to locate `extract.py`.
- `import()` with parentheses is a **dynamic import**: it returns a Promise and its argument can be any expression. This comes back in the "opaque" section below.

---

## 2. Contracts: JSON Schema and ajv

### What it is

**JSON Schema** is a standard for describing, in JSON, what a JSON document should look like. Every stage of Bauify has a schema for its output: `schemas/raw-facts.schema.json`, `schemas/module-graph.schema.json`, `schemas/findings.schema.json`.

**ajv** is the most widely used JSON Schema validator for Node. The code is in `extract/shared/schema.mjs`:

```js
import Ajv2020 from 'ajv/dist/2020.js';           // the draft 2020-12 flavour
const ajv = new Ajv2020({ allErrors: true, strict: true, strictRequired: false });
const validate = ajv.compile(schema);              // compile the schema into a validation function
if (!validate(data)) console.log(validate.errors); // each error carries instancePath and message
```

### Why

The contract comes before the code. Once a schema is written, extract's output is validated **before it is written to disk**, and graphs' input is validated **as soon as it is read**. A stage that emits non-conforming JSON fails immediately with `extract/schema-invalid` instead of making the next stage crash mysteriously.

Two constructs in the schemas worth a look:

```json
"if":   { "properties": { "resolved": { "const": true } } },
"then": { "required": ["to"] },
"else": { "not": { "required": ["to"] } }
```

This is a **conditional constraint**: when `resolved` is true, `to` must be present; when false, it must not be. The invariant used to live in a comment; a reviewer pointed out that a comment is not a constraint, so it became something the schema enforces.

`"additionalProperties": false` forbids fields the schema does not list, so an adapter cannot quietly smuggle private fields into the public contract.

### Where it bites

- Draft 2020-12 must be imported from `ajv/dist/2020.js`; the default `ajv` export only knows draft-07 and reports "no schema with key or ref".
- ajv's `strict: true` rejects a `then` that `required`s a property defined one level up (`strictRequired`). We switch `strictRequired` off and keep every other strict check.

## 3. extract/ts: the TypeScript Compiler API

### What it is

TypeScript is a language, but the `typescript` package also exposes the compiler as an API that parses source into an **AST** (abstract syntax tree) and performs type analysis. It parses plain JavaScript too (`allowJs: true`), so Bauify uses it for both JS and TS.

### What an AST is

An AST is a tree representation of source code. The line `import { a } from './x.mjs'` becomes an `ImportDeclaration` node with an `ImportClause` (what is imported) and a `StringLiteral` (where from) underneath. Analysing code means finding nodes of particular kinds in the tree.

The traversal in `extract/ts/index.mjs` (`collectImports`):

```js
const visit = (node) => {
  if (ts.isImportDeclaration(node) && ts.isStringLiteral(node.moduleSpecifier)) {
    found.push({ specifier: node.moduleSpecifier.text, kind: 'static', line: lineOf(source, node), … });
  } else if (ts.isCallExpression(node) && node.expression.kind === ts.SyntaxKind.ImportKeyword) {
    // import(...) — dynamic import
  }
  ts.forEachChild(node, visit);   // recurse into every child
};
visit(sourceFile);
```

The `ts.isXxx(node)` functions are type guards that test a node's kind; `ts.forEachChild` walks depth-first.

### Program and type checker

At first Bauify parsed one file at a time with `ts.createSourceFile`. The upstream reviewer changed it to `ts.createProgram(files, { noResolve: true, noLib: true })` plus `program.getTypeChecker()` because of a real bug:

```js
function local() { require('./dep'); var require = (s) => s; }
```

Here `require` is a local variable, not the CommonJS loader. Syntax alone cannot tell; the type checker's `getSymbolAtLocation(identifier)` says which declaration an identifier is bound to — no declaration means the global `require`, a declaration means a local. `noResolve` and `noLib` make the Program do lexical binding only, without resolving modules or the standard library, so the cost stays acceptable.

### Module resolution

`ts.resolveModuleName(specifier, containingFile, options, ts.sys)` resolves `'../shared/cli.mjs'` to an absolute path by Node's rules. Bauify then checks whether that path is inside the analyzed root and in the file set, and classifies the import as resolved / outside / unknown.

### Why not dependency-cruiser or Babel

They only give import edges. The symbol and call graphs in M2 need references and calls, which the TS API yields in the same traversal, so there is no need for a second parser.

### Where it bites

- `node.getStart(source)` needs the sourceFile argument; without it, positions are wrong in Program mode.
- Sorting with `localeCompare` depends on the operating system locale and differs between machines — see section 9.

---

## 4. extract/py: Python's standard-library `ast` in a subprocess

### What it is

Python ships an `ast` module that does what the TS parser does: `ast.parse(source)` gives the tree, `ast.walk(tree)` traverses it. `extract/py/extract.py` uses only the standard library; nothing needs to be pip-installed.

```python
for node in ast.walk(tree):
    if isinstance(node, ast.Import):          # import a.b as c
        …
    elif isinstance(node, ast.ImportFrom):    # from ..pkg import x, y
        level = node.level                    # number of leading dots: 0 absolute, 1 this package, 2 the parent
        module = node.module or ""            # None for `from . import x`
```

The script also records two things the rules need later: whether an import sits inside a function body (`lazy`, decided by the line ranges of every `def`), and every name bound at module scope with the line where it becomes bound (`symbols`: functions, classes, assignments, import aliases; it walks into top-level `if` / `try` / `with` blocks but not into function or class bodies).

### Subprocess and inter-process communication

Node cannot run Python code directly, so `extract/py/index.mjs` starts a Python process with `child_process.spawnSync`, writes the file list as JSON to its **stdin**, and reads JSON back from its **stdout**:

```js
const result = spawnSync('python3', [SCRIPT], { input: JSON.stringify(request), encoding: 'utf8' });
const output = JSON.parse(result.stdout);
```

`spawnSync` is synchronous: Node waits for Python to finish. For a command-line tool that is the simplest option; no concurrency to manage.

The interpreter is usually `python` on Windows and `python3` on Linux / macOS, and Windows also has the `py -3` launcher. The code tries the three in order and reports `extract/python-unavailable` only when all fail; `BAUIFY_PYTHON` names an interpreter explicitly.

### Why resolution happens on the Node side

The Python script only emits raw import statements; turning `from utils import logger` into `utils/logger.py` happens in Node. That way the definitions of external / outside / unknown / opaque exist once, and the two languages cannot drift apart.

### Python import semantics (the part newcomers find hardest)

- **Package**: a directory with `__init__.py`. `import pkg` actually loads `pkg/__init__.py`.
- **Relative import**: the dots in `from .a import x` mean "relative to the package this file is in". `level=1` is the same directory, `level=2` the parent. Leaving the analyzed root is recorded as `outside`.
- **`from pkg import name`** has two readings: `name` is `pkg/name.py` (a submodule) or a variable defined in `pkg/__init__.py` (an attribute). The code tries the submodule first and falls back to the attribute, pointing at `__init__.py`.
- **PEP 420 namespace packages**: since Python 3.3 a directory **without** `__init__.py` can be a package. ai-voice's `utils/` and `asr/` are of this kind. It has no file of its own, so only `from ns import submodule` yields an edge; `from ns import attribute` is `unknown`. This was discovered on a real repository: the first version had 56 resolution failures.
- **Search path for absolute imports**: real Python searches `sys.path`; Bauify cannot know the user's runtime, so it follows the common convention: the repository root first, then `src/`.
- **Dynamic imports**: `importlib.import_module("a.b")` resolves when the argument is a literal; a variable is recorded as `opaque`.
- **Partial initialisation**: when A imports B and B imports A, Python does not fail by itself. The module being loaded is already in `sys.modules`, so the second `import a` simply returns the half-built module. It only fails when B does `from a import X` and A has not yet executed the line that binds `X`. This distinction is what the `import-cycle` rule's tiers are built on (section 8).

---

## 5. The four kinds of "unresolved": why they are counted separately

`raw-facts.json` has four counters under `unresolved`, all `required`:

| category | meaning | expectation |
|---|---|---|
| `external` | a bare module name or `node:` prefix: third-party or standard library | mostly normal |
| `outside` | resolved, but the file is outside the analyzed root | usually a test referencing a script one level up |
| `unknown` | looks like a path but no file is there | **should be 0**; non-zero means a resolution gap or a broken reference in the code |
| `opaque` | the argument of `import()` / `require()` / `import_module()` is not a string literal | the blind spot of static analysis; it must stay visible |

`opaque` is the important one. Archify's `bin/archify.mjs` starts renderers with `spawnSync(process.execPath, [rendererPath])` and loads the delta module with `import(pathToFileURL(path.join(...)))` — both are calls whose target is only known at run time. The diagram has **no edge** from `bin` to the renderers, and that is a fact; but if the edge were merely missing, a reader would assume `bin` does not depend on the renderers. The count says "there are 3 dynamic loads here that cannot be seen", which is what ARCHITECTURE.md means by "omissions stay visible".

---

## 6. Small utilities: glob matching, file roles, Git

### glob → regular expression

`**/test/**` and `**/*.{js,mjs}` in `config/defaults.json` are **glob** patterns, a shorthand for paths. Node 18 has no stable built-in glob, so `extract/shared/glob.mjs` hand-writes a translator from glob to regular expression: `**` → any number of directory levels, `*` → any characters within one segment, `{a,b}` → either. A reviewer added one edge case: an unclosed `{` used to loop forever and now reports `cli/config-invalid`.

### File roles

Every file is tagged `source` / `test` / `generated`. The rules are globs, with precedence **test > generated > source**: `test/generated-artifact-xml.test.mjs` matches two of them and is a test. The precedence was decided after a test caught the ambiguity.

### Git

`extract/shared/git.mjs` runs three **read-only** commands through `spawnSync('git', [...])`: `rev-parse --show-toplevel` (repository root), `rev-parse HEAD` (the 40-hex sha of the current commit), and `remote get-url origin` (the remote URL). These are Git's "plumbing" commands with stable output made for programs. Without Git everything returns null and analysis proceeds; evidence mode is simply unavailable.

---

## 7. graphs/module: graph basics and metrics

### From a file graph to a module graph

Edges in raw-facts go from file to file. `graphs/module.mjs` maps every file to a module (by configured groups, package boundary, or directory depth; root-level files become modules of their own) and **merges** file edges into module edges: several file edges between the same pair of modules become one, `weight` is the count, `kinds` counts static versus dynamic, and `evidence` keeps up to five file:line entries.

Deduplicating with a `Map` is the idiomatic JS pattern:

```js
const key = `${from} ${to}`;
if (!edgeMap.has(key)) edgeMap.set(key, { from, to, weight: 0, … });
edgeMap.get(key).weight += 1;
```

### fan-in, fan-out, instability

- **fan-in**: how many other modules depend on me (incoming edges). High = widely used, change with care.
- **fan-out**: how many other modules I depend on (outgoing edges). High = fragile, I follow whenever they change.
- **instability** I = fanOut / (fanIn + fanOut). 0 is a pure sink (only depended on), 1 a pure source (only depends). The metric is Robert C. Martin's, from *Agile Software Development*; the healthy direction is "unstable depends on stable".

With no edges at all I is `null`, not 0: no data is not pretended into a number.

### Why test and generated files are excluded

Test files import almost everything; keeping them would push every module's fan-in up and make the metric meaningless. Generated files (`generated-validators.mjs`) are build products and reflect no design. They are excluded but **counted** (`excluded.files`), so the diagram's card can say "102 files not drawn".

---

## 8. evaluate: rules, Tarjan, and the partial-initialisation proof

### The rule engine

`evaluate/index.mjs` loads each rule module, runs it with the module graph, the raw facts, and the configuration, and gives every finding a stable id (`COUP-0001`) after a deterministic sort. Rules do not read each other's output. A suppressed rule is counted in `summary.suppressed` rather than silently skipped.

### Strongly connected components

A cycle in a directed graph is a set of nodes that can all reach each other. **Tarjan's algorithm** finds every such set (a strongly connected component, SCC) in one depth-first pass, keeping a stack and, for each node, the lowest index reachable from it. Both `coupling/cycle` (over modules) and `coupling/import-cycle` (over files) use it; an SCC of size one is not a cycle. A second BFS then picks the **shortest** cycle inside the SCC so the message can quote one concrete loop rather than the whole component.

### Why the tiers

`import-cycle` excludes type-only imports from runtime analysis, then runs
Tarjan over all runtime edges and over the module-scope, unconditional subset.
Mixed components are informational with `loading: not-proven`: a deferred
function can still run during module initialization. Module-scope components
warn with `potential-at-import`. `findPartialInitCandidate` may attach a
binding-order hypothesis under `partialInitCandidate`, setting
`potential-partial-init`; this is not an execution proof and never raises the
severity to error. Tests compare small authored fixtures with real Python/JS
loading, including counterexamples to the former safety and failure claims.
Runtime-risk confidence 0.7 is an ordinal heuristic, not a measured probability.

Python uses an AST visitor to distinguish function bodies from enclosing
default/decorator expressions, mark TYPE_CHECKING-only and conditional edges,
and include the package initializers a submodule import loads. TypeScript
marks explicit type-only edges and deferred import()/require() calls, and
uses tsconfig options when resolving aliases and inline type specifiers.
The graph keeps structural dependencies, assigns collision-safe module IDs,
and stores exact file ownership for the overlay. After schema shape checks,
semantic validation verifies uniqueness and cross-record references.

### Hub

`coupling/hub` is arithmetic on the module graph: fan-in and fan-out both at or above the configured thresholds. The thresholds are echoed in the finding so the reader can see what was compared.

## 9. overlay/inject: layering onto Archify's HTML

### What it does

`buildOverlay` takes the delivered HTML as a string, computes one record per component (modules, files, edges, indicators, findings), and inserts three blocks before `</body>`: a `<script type="application/json">` with the data, a `<style>`, and a `<script>` with the page logic. Nothing in the original markup is edited, and the result is written to a new file. Everything the page needs is embedded — it works from a file:// URL with no network.

### Mapping components to modules

A component's `sources` in the IR name files; the deepest module whose path contains that file claims the component, and descendants follow their parent unless another component claims them. `--map` replaces this with an explicit `{ componentId: [moduleId] }` table. A module no component claims is listed, not dropped.

### Indicators and the halo

For each component the indicators are computed on the Node side from the findings that touch it: the cycle indicator looks at `import-cycle` findings on its files and `cycle` findings on its modules and takes the worst tier; the hub indicator looks for `hub` findings on its modules; instability is fan-out over fan-in plus fan-out summed over its modules. The component's colour is the worst indicator. On the page, `drawLayer` draws one rounded `rect` per component in an SVG group appended to Archify's SVG, sized from `getBBox()` of the component's `g[data-node-id]`, pushed 10 px outside the box and blurred with a CSS filter so it reads as a halo rather than a second border; red animates.

### Diagrams and source excerpts

The second panel's diagrams are plain SVG strings built in the page: the cycle ring places the files of the shortest cycle on an ellipse and draws clipped arrows between them (dashed when the closing import is lazy); the hub star puts dependents on the left and dependencies on the right; instability is two bars and a marker on a 0–1 scale. With `--source`, `collectSnippets` reads every file a finding cites from the analyzed tree and embeds its full text, so the third panel can show the cited line inside the whole file.

### Where it bites

- The overlay script lives inside a JavaScript template literal in `inject.mjs`, so a backslash in a regular expression there has to be doubled (`\\.git$`) or the template literal eats it before the browser sees it.
- Archify's viewer defines the CSS variables the panels use (`--panel`, `--bg`, `--text`, …). A variable that does not exist (`--panel-bg` was one such guess) silently falls back to nothing and makes text invisible in one theme.

---

## 10. bridge/to-archify: graph algorithms and layout

This is the most algorithm-dense file in the repository, though it is no longer the main path (see ARCHITECTURE.md §2.5).

### Folding to 12 nodes

Archify recommends at most 12 main nodes per diagram. `foldToBudget` folds **whole sibling groups** into their parent directory, deepest first: `tools/dram`, `tools/finance`, … all merge into `tools`. The first version stopped as soon as the count reached 12, which left half of `tools/*` folded and half not; a test caught it, and folding became all-or-nothing per group. Folding **remaps** edges: an edge into a folded module now points at the parent, a parent–child edge becomes a self-loop and is removed, and fan-in / fan-out are recomputed.

### Breaking cycles with DFS, then layering

Real dependency graphs often have cycles. To lay nodes out in layers the graph must first become a DAG (directed acyclic graph). **Depth-first search** does it: nodes are marked "in progress" while being visited; an edge that points at an in-progress node is a **back edge**, part of a cycle, and is ignored for layering (`state.get(next) === 1` in `layerModules`).

Layering uses **longest path**: topologically sort, then set each node's layer to the maximum of its predecessors' layers plus one. Sources (no incoming edges) sit in layer 0; the deepest sink is at the bottom.

### Topological order and Kahn's algorithm

`orderLanes` uses **Kahn's algorithm**: keep the set of unplaced items, take every item whose constraints are satisfied each round, and pick one by a stable rule. The constraints say which edge must sit above which (below). When constraints form a cycle (nested spans), it falls back to sorting by span — the unavoidable crossing.

### Why one module per column

Archify treats "an edge passes through an unrelated node" as a hard error. With one module per column, a vertical segment only ever crosses its own column, which contains no other node. The cost is width; that is a known limitation.

Columns are ordered by instability ascending: sinks on the left, sources on the right, so most lanes run right-to-left towards sinks and a source's short vertical rarely lands inside someone else's horizontal span.

### Explicit routing: `via` and lanes

Archify has no automatic layout, only `grid` mode and explicit `via` waypoints. Every edge takes three segments: straight down from the source's bottom to a **lane** (a horizontal line in the gap below the row, one per edge, 24 px apart), horizontally to the target's column, and down to the target's top. Back edges (pointing upwards) leave from the top through the gap above. The label is pinned with `labelAt` on the lane near the source, where no other column's vertical can be.

Lanes within one gap are ordered by two rules: if an edge's **source** falls inside another edge's horizontal span, it must be above; if its **target** falls inside another's span, it must be below. When neither can be satisfied (nested spans) they cross.

### standard versus showcase

Archify's `showcase` profile demands zero crossings. Real dependency graphs are mostly non-planar (they cross however they are drawn), so Bauify declares `standard` by default: crossings are warnings, the diagram is delivered, and evidence is still verified.

### Evidence mode

`meta.repository` and each node's `sources` are written only when both conditions hold: the revision is a 40-hex sha and the origin is github.com (the ssh form `git@github.com:a/b.git` is normalised to `https://github.com/a/b`). Once written, `archify deliver --repo-root` uses git to check that every path exists at that commit — so Bauify does not claim evidence itself; it hands Archify verifiable leads.

---

## 11. Determinism: why "byte-identical" matters so much

"Run twice on the same input, get byte-identical output" is a hard constraint, because it makes `diff` of two analyses equivalent to `diff` of the code structure. The code is careful everywhere:

- Every array is sorted by a stable key before output (files by path, edges by from / line / specifier).
- No timestamps, no absolute paths (`repository.root` is relative to the Git root).
- **No `localeCompare`.** It sorts by the operating system's language setting; `ä` and `z` order differently under the `C` locale and `sv_SE`. Byte-order comparison `a < b ? -1 : a > b ? 1 : 0` is used instead. A reviewer found this and the fix followed.
- `JSON.stringify(value, null, 2)` emits properties in insertion order, so objects are constructed with a fixed field order.

One test runs the pipeline twice and compares bytes.

---

## 12. Failure is a structured diagnostic

Bauify never prints a Node stack trace to the user. Every failure is an object of a fixed shape (`extract/shared/diagnostics.mjs`):

```json
{ "code": "extract/adapter-ambiguous", "severity": "error",
  "message": "More than one language adapter matches; choose one explicitly.",
  "subject": { "root": "…" }, "evidence": { "detected": ["ts", "py"] },
  "supportedFixes": ["pass --language ts", "pass --language py"] }
```

Implementation: `fail(code, message, details)` throws a custom `DiagnosticError`; the outermost `try/catch` in `bin/analyze.mjs` catches it, `--json` mode prints `{ status: "failed", diagnostics: [...] }`, human mode prints `code: message` and the fixes, and the process exits with 1. An unexpected error that is not a `DiagnosticError` takes the same path with code `internal/unclassified` — it says "unclassified" rather than inventing a fix.

The shape is identical to Archify's diagnostic contract, which is why findings could attach to Archify node cards later.

---

## 13. Tests: node:test, fixtures, self-analysis

### node:test

Node 18 ships a test runner, so there is no jest to install. `node --test test/*.test.mjs` runs every file; each `test('name', fn)` asserts with `node:assert/strict`. `{ skip: 'reason' }` skips instead of failing — that is how the Archify-dependent tests behave when no checkout is present.

### Synthetic fixtures

`test/fixtures/ts-basic/` and `py-basic/` are hand-written miniature repositories; each file is a few lines long and covers one case (relative imports, namespace packages, a syntax error, a dynamic import with a computed path, …). The `expected.json` next to them was **derived by hand first, then confirmed by running the program**. The tests are `assert.deepEqual(actual, expected)`. Their value: when a change alters one edge, you know immediately which file and line.

### Regression tests

Each test in `test/extract-regressions.test.mjs` corresponds to a bug a review caught: locale sorting, the `..generated/` misclassification, the glob infinite loop, the local `require`. Breaking one of them again reproduces instantly.

### Rule tests

`test/evaluate.test.mjs` builds tiny graphs and fact sets in memory and checks the tiers of `import-cycle` field by field; the proof case (`from b import foo` before `foo` exists) mirrors a two-file layout that really raises `ImportError` in Python.

### Self-analysis

Analysing Archify's own `archify/` package asserts the three layers `bin → renderers/* → renderers/shared`, that `shared` has fan-out 0, that there is no static edge from bin to the renderers but `opaque ≥ 1`, and finally validates the bridge output with Archify's own `validate`. This tests Bauify and doubles as a health check of the upstream code structure.

### Running the CLI as a subprocess

`runCli` in `test/helpers.mjs` really starts the command line with `spawnSync(process.execPath, [CLI, ...args])` rather than calling functions directly. What gets tested is what a user meets: exit codes, the JSON on stdout, the text on stderr.

---

## 14. Cross-platform: what you meet on Windows

- **Path separators**: Windows uses `\`, POSIX `/`. Every path written into JSON goes through `toPosix()` and becomes `/`; otherwise the same repository yields different artifacts on two machines.
- **Line endings**: Windows Git defaults to `autocrlf=true` and converts LF to CRLF on checkout. `* text=auto eol=lf` in `.gitattributes` keeps the repository on LF; `lineCount` accepts `/\r\n|\n|\r/`.
- **Symbolic links**: an ordinary Windows user cannot create symlinks without Developer Mode. A batch of Archify's tests fails on Windows for that reason; it has nothing to do with Bauify.
- **Temporary directory**: never hard-code `/tmp`; use `os.tmpdir()`.
- **Interpreter names**: `python` / `python3` / `py -3`, see section 4.
- **ESM and Windows absolute paths**: `import('C:\\...')` throws `ERR_UNSUPPORTED_ESM_URL_SCHEME`; wrap the path with `pathToFileURL()` first. This was a real upstream Windows bug.

- TypeScript Compiler API: the official wiki page "Using the Compiler API"; printing a small tree with `ts.createSourceFile` teaches more than the docs.
- Python `ast`: the `ast` module documentation; `ast.dump(ast.parse("from . import x"), indent=2)` shows the structure in one line. For circular imports, the language reference section on the import system explains `sys.modules` and partial initialisation.
